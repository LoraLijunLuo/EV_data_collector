# 🚗 EV Market & Charging Infrastructure Insights – Denmark 🇩🇰
This project analyzes the electric vehicle (EV) market and charging infrastructure locations in Denmark. It combines technical specifications from various EV models with geospatial data on public charging stations to derive insights into performance, price-efficiency, and infrastructure coverage.

The project was designed as an end-to-end data workflow, from web scraping and API integration to data cleaning, transformation, storage, and interactive dashboard design. All work was independently completed in a self-learning setting to deepen my applied data skills.



## 📊 Dashboard
👉 [View the interactive Tableau Dashboard here](https://public.tableau.com/views/ElectricVehicleMarketInfrastructureAnalysisinDenmark/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## 🔧 Technologies
- Python: Web scraping (requests, BeautifulSoup), data cleaning (pandas), API integration, CSV transformation
- SQL: Structured schema design for normalized storage (EV specs, battery, charging stations)
- Tableau: Map-based visualization, scatter plots, filters, custom tooltips, calculated fields, dashboard composition
- Git & GitHub: Version control, public documentation

📌 This was my first Tableau dashboard, which I completed through independent learning and hands-on iteration.
📦 Data sources: [ev-database.org](https://ev-database.org), [OpenChargeMap API](https://openchargemap.org)

## 🔍 Key Insights
- 🚗 Hyundai and Kia dominate the top 10 in range-to-price efficiency, with 5 out of 10 best-value models across the dataset
- 🔋 Higher driving range does not always correlate with higher battery capacity, highlighting brand-level differences in energy efficiency
- 🗺️ Charging stations are geographically distributed across Denmark, supporting both urban and regional EV access

## 📈 What I Learned
- Built full ETL workflows from web data
- Independently mastered Tableau as a new visualization tool and applied it to a real-world dataset, including custom maps, calculated fields, and interactive dashboard layouts
- Practiced designing stakeholder-friendly dashboards for non-technical users

## 🧩 Future Improvements
- Add NLP-based sentiment analysis on EV consumer reviews
- Enable cross-country comparison and infrastructure accessibility scoring
